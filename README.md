## Setup and Running
- Prerequisites
  - Node
  - MySQL (or Postgres / Sqlite / MSSQL)
- Clone repo `git clone git@github.com:spanoff/fenixpack.git fenixpack`
- Switch to `code` directory `cd code`
- Configurations
  - Modify `/api/src/config/database.json` for database credentials
  - Modify `/api/.env` for PORT (optional)
  - Modify `/web/.env` for PORT / API URL (optional)
  - Modify `/mobile/src/setup/config.json` for API URL (tip: use `ifconfig` to get your local IP address)
- Setup
  - API: Install packages and database setup (migrations and seed) `cd api` and `npm run setup`
  - Webapp: Install packages `cd web` and `npm install`
  - Mobile: Install packages `cd mobile` and `npm install`
- Development
  - Run API `cd api` and `npm start`, browse GraphiQL at http://localhost:8000/
  - Run Webapp `cd web` and `npm start`, browse webapp at http://localhost:3000/
  - Run Mobile `cd mobile` and `npm start`, browse mobile on either emulator or using Expo on your mobile phone
- Production
  - Run API `cd api` and `npm run start:prod`, creates an optimized build in `build` directory and runs the server

## Why open source a project and not a boilerplate or framework?
- While building a new project with Node, you can basically start scratch, adding libraries and tools as you go on building it further.
- Comparing with any other languague, you usually start with a framework, for example, Laravel (PHP), Django (Python) or Ruby on Rails (Ruby) which includes a ton of features and codebase which you never end up using.
- I've personally found, learning by going through a good project codebase step by step while building your own project helps in ease of understanding and remembering
